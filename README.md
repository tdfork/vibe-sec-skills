## Introduction

AI-generated code now represents a meaningful share of new commits across the industry. While modern coding assistants excel at producing code that *works*, they routinely ship code with classic security pitfalls: hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, missing access controls, weak password hashing, JWT misuse, and broken CORS configurations. These mistakes rarely surface in functional testing — they surface in incident reports.

vbsec brings production-grade security review into the AI coding loop. It runs as a native Claude Code skill — type `/vbs-scan-security` and receive a structured report covering 20+ categories of vulnerabilities. There are no external API calls, no separate tool installation, and no additional infrastructure to maintain.

vbsec has been exercised against intentionally vulnerable open-source training apps such as OWASP Juice Shop — and identifies findings that line up with the documented vulnerability challenges across SQL injection, NoSQL injection, JWT misuse, broken access control, mass assignment, deserialization RCE, and more.

Generic rules apply to every language. Specialized rule overlays exist for Go, PHP, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Python, covering common frameworks: React, Vue, Angular, Express, NestJS, Next.js, Django, Flask, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, Prisma, and Mongoose. Additional language overlays are on the roadmap.

## Authors

- **Bùi Tấn Việt** — CEO, [SePay](https://sepay.vn) & [123HOST](https://123host.vn)

## How it works

vbsec is engineered around a small set of design choices that distinguish it from conventional pattern scanners.

- **Reasoning-first, not pattern counting.** vbsec does not blindly grep for `eval(` or `query(`. Each potential finding is verified by reading the surrounding code, tracing data flow (L1 untrusted user input through L4 trusted system data), and confirming the data reaches a dangerous sink without sanitization. This eliminates the false-positive flood typical of regex-based scanners.

- **Size-aware routing.** Small scans (≤20 main-language files AND ≤30 total) run inline in 30-60 seconds. Larger scans automatically delegate work to sub-agents that run in parallel — one chunk per top-level folder — and aggregate findings centrally. The user experience is identical; only the execution strategy changes.

- **Sub-agent delegation for large repositories.** For repositories with hundreds of files, vbsec spawns up to three parallel sub-agents through Claude Code's general-purpose agent. Each sub-agent scans a chunk of files independently, and findings are dedupe-aggregated by `(file, line, rule_id)`. This keeps wall-clock time bounded even on monorepos.

- **Language overlay system.** When vbsec detects the primary language, it loads language-specific rule files from `rules/languages/<lang>/` that override the generic rules for that language. This catches framework-specific patterns: Mongoose `$where` NoSQL injection, Angular `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, Sequelize template-literal SQL, JWT algorithm confusion, Gin debug mode in production builds.

- **L1–L4 data flow classification.** Inputs are classified by trust level. A `db.query(\`SELECT ${x}\`)` call is only reported as a finding when `x` originates from L1 (user-controlled input) and reaches the SQL sink without parameterization. Constants, environment variables, and trusted-source data do not generate false positives.

- **One finding, one rule.** A line of code that triggers both IDOR and Race Condition produces two findings — never a comma-separated double tag. This keeps counts honest, reports auditable, and the trailing JSON summary machine-parseable.

- **Bilingual reports.** Vietnamese is the default; English is selected with `lang=en`. The JSON summary at the report tail is always canonical English for CI and tooling consumption.

## Installation

vbsec installs as a Claude Code skill. Run these two commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanviet12/vbsec ~/vbsec
ln -sfn ~/vbsec/skills/vbs-scan-security ~/.claude/skills/vbs-scan-security
```

Restart Claude Code, then verify:

```
/vbs-scan-security
```

To update later:

```bash
cd ~/vbsec && git pull
```

(Restart Claude Code to pick up the new version.)

See [docs/en/installation.md](docs/en/installation.md) for prerequisites, troubleshooting, and update procedures.

## Usage

The default scope is the entire repository. This is a deliberate change from earlier versions and matches how teams typically request a security audit.

```bash
/vbs-scan-security                       # scan entire repo (default)
/vbs-scan-security uncommitted           # only scan uncommitted changes
/vbs-scan-security pr id 42 lang=en      # scan a PR, report in English
/vbs-scan-security commit within 7days   # scan last 7 days of commits
```

Reports are saved to `vbsec-reports/scan-<timestamp>.md` inside the scanned repository for re-reading, sharing with reviewers, and attaching to remediation tickets.

See [docs/en/usage.md](docs/en/usage.md) for all options including `staged`, single-commit scans, and PR scanning via `gh`.

- v0.3 — Default scope changed to full-repo, persistent reports, verbose per-finding explanations ✅
- v0.4 (current) — Python specialization (SQLAlchemy/Django ORM SQLi, pickle/yaml deserialization RCE, Werkzeug debugger, FastAPI/Flask/Django CSRF + CORS, PyJWT algorithms, subprocess shell=True) ✅
- v0.5 — Codex compatibility (`.codex/skills/`)
- v0.6+ — Ruby, Java, Rust — community-driven

## Disclaimer

vbsec is a reference scanner. It catches common AI-generated code mistakes, but:

- It does NOT replace a professional security audit
- It does NOT guarantee 100% vulnerability coverage
- It does NOT fetch live CVE databases (run `npm audit` / `pip-audit` / `govulncheck` separately for that)

Use vbsec as a **first line of defense**, not as proof of security.
